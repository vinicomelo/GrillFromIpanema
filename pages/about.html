            <p>Alcy De Souza, started cooking early in life. As a kid, he used to help his mother in the kitchen preparing meals for his younger siblings and never stopped from there. With an entrepreneur spirit and a vision to have a Brazilian restaurant
                in the US, Alcy De Souza came to USA in 1987 to pursue his American dream. At the Grill From Ipanema, Alcy saw the opportunity to create a contemporary restaurant bringing back the flavors of the Brazilian cuisine to the USA. Alcy wanted
                to stay faithful to roots of Brazilian cuisine and so he crafted a menu that included dishes such as the Feijoada, Moqueca a Baiana, Picanha, Bobo de Camarao. Alcy makes sure he offers only the freshest ingredients in the dishes. Alcy
                understands that Brazilians have a peculiar way of preparing and appreciating food. He understands that informality and simplicity may also be chic.</p>
